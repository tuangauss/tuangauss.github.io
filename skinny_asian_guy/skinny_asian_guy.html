      				<blockquote>"You need to eat more! For a person of your height, you just need to gain more weight"<br>
                    "Dude! Hit the gymn and your physique will get a lot better"</blockquote>

      				<p>Have you ever been in a situation where your parents, friends, relatives urge you to gain weight, do exercise, hit the gym in order to have "a nicer physique"? From high school to college, I often heard people making fun of how small I look and how underweight I must be even for a Vietnamese guy. I often took these comments with a pinch of salt. For somebody who is 1m69 (5'6) in height and 58kg (127lb) in weight, I have close-to-perfect BMI index (20.3).</p>
      				<div class = "w3-container w3-center"><img src="http://clipart-library.com/data_images/187613.gif" alt="skinny-guy" style="width:60%" class = "w3-center">
 					<p class = "w3-center" style = "margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 15px"><em>I don't look quite like this but you get the idea.</em> Image source: Clip Art Library</p></div>
                    
                    <p>Ok, I get it, nobody is talking about BMI or how healthy I am trying to convince myself here. Thinking about it, people may have a good point: given that I am slightly taller than an average Vietnamese male (1m62 - 5'3), I may look a little skinnier than an average Vietnamese male. The logic is quite simple, isn't it? If you stretch yourself a little bit and not have some extra weight, you should look, well, "lengthier" and skinnier. That's a bad joke but I decided that this was a good topic to investigate.</p>


      				<p>We need a methodological way to investigate into this topic. A good way to go forward is to find as much data of Vietnamese men's height and weight as possible, conduct a regression analysis based on the data, make inference about the general population and see where I stand among the Vietnamese males.</p>

      				<p>After browsing through the web, I found out a survey research data<a href = "#data_source" style = "text-decoration:none"><sup>1</sup></a> that contains demographic information of more than 10,000 Vietnamese people. I limited the sample size to Male of the age group 18-29. This allows me to have a sample size of 383 Vietnamese males whose age are around 18-29, which is probably good enough for my regression analysis.</p>

      				<p>At first, let's plot the data's weight and see how I would fit in among the young Vietnamese men.</p>

      				<div class = "w3-container w3-center"><img src="./img/weight_density.png" alt="weight_density" style="width:80%" class = "w3-center">
 					<p class = "w3-center" style = "margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 15px"><em>The red line shows the median of the sample while the orange line shows the mean</em></p></div>

      				<p>This seems fine, which suggests that I am slightly below both the average and median weights of those 383 Vietnamese young men. However, the question is not about how my weight compares to such sample size per se, but <em><strong>given the height of 1m68</strong></em> what can we infer about my weight compared to the <strong>entire Vietnamese population</strong>, which is assumed to be represented by our sample? To do this, we need to dive into a regression analysis.</p>

      				<p> At first, let's plot a 2-dimensional scatter plot of heights and weights</p>
                    
                    <div class = "w3-container w3-center"><img src="./img/weight_vs_height.png" alt="weightvsheight" style="width:80%" class = "w3-center"></div>
 					
 					<p>I just look average. More importantly, it does seem that there is overwhelmingly strong evidence to suggest a positive linear relationship between the height and weight of Vietnamese male. We will do a quantitative analysis to get to the bottom of this relationship.</p>

<p>First, let's quickly add a "standard least square" line. I will say more about this line later and just show it for now. </p>

					<div class = "w3-container w3-center"><img src="./img/regression_line.png" alt="line_regress" style="width:80%"></div>
					<p>We could interpret our least-squares line \(y = -86.32+0.889x\) as suggesting that the usual profile of a Vietnamese male at my age is such that an increase in 1 cm of height would observe an increase in weight of 0.88kg.</p>

                    <p>However, this does not answer our question; that is, given somebody of my height (1m68), is 58kg considered too much, too little or just about average? To rephrase this question in a more quantitative manner, if we have a distribution of all of those who are 1m68 in height, what is the chance of my weight falls into the 25,50 or 75-percentile? To do this, let's dig deeper into Regression.</p>

					<h3>The theory of Linear Regression:</h3>
                    
                    <p>In a linear regression model, the expected value of the \(Y\) variable is a linear function of \(x\). Letâ€™s call the intercept and slope of this linear relationship \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\); that is, we assume that \(E(Y | X = x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x\). We do not know \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\) so we treat these as unknown parameters.</p>
                    
                    <p>In the most standard linear regression model, we further assume that the conditional distribution of \(Y\) given \(X = x\) is Normal.</p>
					<p>This means that simple linear regression model:</p>
                    $$Y = \beta_0 +\beta_1x + \epsilon$$
                    <p id = "equation_1"> can be rewritten as: </p>
                    \begin{equation}
                    \mu_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i
                    \end{equation}
                    $$y_i \sim N(\mu_i, \sigma)$$
				    <p><em>Note that in many models, we can replace <strong>variance</strong> parameter \(\sigma\) with <strong>precision</strong> parameter \(\tau\), where \(\tau = 1/\sigma\).</em> From this point in the post, we will use \(\tau\).</p>
                    <p><strong>To summarize:</strong> dependent variable \(Y\) follows normal distribution parametrized by mean \(\mu_i\), that is a linear function of \(X\) parametrized by \(\beta_0\),\(\beta_1\), and by precision parameter \(\tau\).


				<p> Finally, it only remains to say what we are assuming about the variance/precision. In particular, we are assuming the unknown variance does not depend on \(x\); this assumption is called <strong>homoscedasticity</strong>.
                
                <p> That's a lot, but you can visualize what I have discussed with this photo </p>
                <div class = "w3-container w3-center"><img src="./img/linear_model.PNG" alt="linear_model" style="width:60%" class = "w3-center"></div>
 				<p class = "w3-center" style = "margin-bottom: 15px; font-size:15px"><em>In an actual data analysis problem, all we are given is the black dotsâ€”the data. Using the data, our goal is to make inferences about the things we donâ€™t know including \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\) (which determine the shadowy, mysterious, blue dotted line) and \(\sigma\) (which determines the width of the red Normal densities from which the \(y\) data values are drawn).</em>Image source: Joseph Change's Yale S&DS 238 course.</p>
				<h3> Estimating parameters </h3>
                <p>Now, there are a couple of ways you can do to estimate \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\).If you estimate such model using <strong>ordinary least squares</strong>, you do not have to bother about the probabilistic formulation, because you are searching for optimal values of \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\) by minimizing the squared errors of fitted values to predicted values. On another hand, you could estimate such model using <strong>maximum likelihood estimation</strong>, where you would be looking for optimal values of parameters by maximizing the likelihood function</p>
				$$\mathop{\arg\,\max}\limits_{\beta_0, \beta_1, \tau} = \prod_{i=1}^{n} N(y_i;\beta_0 + \beta_1x_i, \tau) $$
                
                <p><em>Note</em>: an interesting result (not demonstrated mathematically here) is that if we make the further assumption that the errors belong to a normal distribution the least squares estimators are also the maximum likelihood estimators.</p>
                
                <h3> Linear Regression with a Bayesian touch: </h3>
                <p>The Bayesian approach, instead of maximizing the likelihood function alone, would assume prior distributions for the parameters and use Bayes theorem:</p>
         
         		$$posterior \propto prior\times likelihood$$
                
                <p id ="equation_2">The likelihood function is the same as above, but what changes is that you assume some prior distributions for the estimated parameters \(\beta_0\), \(\beta_1\), \(\tau\) and include them into the equation:</p>
                
                \begin{equation}
                f(\beta_0, \beta_1, \tau) \propto \prod_{i=1}^{n}N(y_i;\beta_0 + \beta_1x_i, \tau)f_{\beta_0}(\beta_0)f_{\beta_1}(\beta_1)f_{\tau}(\tau)
                \end{equation}
                
                <p>The final estimate will depend on the information that comes from your data and from your priors, but the more information is contained in your data, the less influential are priors.</p>
                <p>"What distributions?" is a different question, since there is unlimited number of choices. We could just choose a Normal prior with a large standard deviation (small precision); for example, we could assume \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\) come from a Normal distribution with mean 0 and SD 10,000 (precision = \(1 \times 10^{-5}\)) or whatever. We can be rather cavalier about this and not worry about which distribution among spread-out distributions might be better or worse because they are all nearly flat in the region where the likelihood is non-negligible, and the posterior distribution doesnâ€™t care what the prior distribution looks like in regions where the likelihood is negligible.</p>
                <p>Similarly, for the precision \(\tau\), we know these must be nonnegative so it makes sense to choose a distribution restricted to nonnegative values if we happen to know a convenient one â€“ for example, we could use an Gamma distribution with low shape and scale paraeter. </p>
                <p>If you choose a uniform distribution for \(\sigma\) or \(\tau\), you may end up with a model that is illustrated by John K. Kruschke</p>

                <h3> JAGS </h3>
                <p>So far so good for the theory. The problem is very rarely does solving <a href = "#equation_2" style = "text-decoration:none">equation (2)</a> is mathematically simple. In vast majority of cases posterior distribution will not be directly available (see how complicated Normal and Gamma distribution is and you have to MULTIPLY them together) and you will have to use Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for estimating the model. JAGS helps us does exactly that.</p>
                
                <p> The idea behind JAGS model is that a simulation process based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo will generate many iterations of parameter space \(\theta = (\beta_0; \beta_1; \tau)\). The distribution of the sample generated for each parameter in this parameter space will approximate (proven mathematically) the population distribution of the parameter.</p>
                
                <p> We run JAGs in R as follows </p>
                <p> - At first, we write our model in text format:</p>
                <pre class="prettyprint lang-r"> mymodel <- "
 model{
  for(i in 1:n){
    y[i] ~ dnorm(a + b*x[i], tau)
  }
  a ~ dnorm(0, 1e-6)
  b ~ dnorm(0, 1e-6)
  tau ~ dgamma(.01,.01)
}
"</pre>
				<p> Then, we command JAGs to conduct the simulation. Here I ask JAGs to simulate the value for the parameter space \(\theta\) 10000 times.</p>
                
               	<pre class="prettyprint lang-r"> jm <- jags.model(file = textConnection(mymodel), data=list(n=n, x=data$height, y=data$weight))
 cs <- coda.samples(jm, c("a","b","tau"), 10000)
 sample_data <- as.data.frame(cs[[1]])</pre>
 				
                <p> After such sampling, we achieve the sampled data of \(\theta = (\beta_0; \beta_1; \tau)\) such as this</p>

                    <p> Great, now we have 10,000 iterations of the parameter space \(\theta\), what do we do now? Remember that by <a href = "#equation_1" style = "text-decoration:none">equation (1)</a>:</p>
                    $$\mu = \beta_0 + \beta_1x$$
                 <p> This means that if we substitute \(x = 168cm\) to each of the iteration, we will find 10,000 values of weight and thus, the <em>distribution</em> of weights <strong>given that</strong> the height is 168cm.
                 <pre class="prettyprint lang-r"> cmean <- sample_data$a + sample_data$b*168 </pre>
                 <p> We are interested in the percentile of my weight, conditional on my height. For any quantity that can be calculated as a function of the parameters we have monitored in the MCMC, we can get a sample from the posterior distribution for that quantity simply by taking that function of the parameters in our MCMC. Weâ€™ll do that for the desired percentile here.</p> 
                 <pre class="prettyprint lang-r"> m_perc <- pnorm(q = m_weight, mean = cmean, sd = sample_data$sig) 
 truehist(m_perc)  </pre>

                <div class = "w3-container w3-center"> <img src="./img/post_weight.png" alt="post_percentile" style="width:80%" class = "w3-center"></div>
 				<p class = "w3-center" style = "margin-bottom: 15px; font-size:15px"><em>Oophs!!! I will not even be in the range.</em></p>
                <p> For example, we can find the percentile that my weight is in the first 40 percentile or less</p>
                <pre class="prettyprint lang-r"> mean(m_perc <= 0.4)
 #  [1]  0.994  </pre>
			    <p> So there is overwhelming evidence that conditional on my height of 168cm, my weight 58kg would leave me at the lower percentile of the Vietnamese population. Much as I hesitate to admit, I am indeed very skinny for somebody of 168cm in height. It's really about time to hit the gym and gain some weights. After all, if you cannot trust some well done Bayesian statistics result, what else can you trust?</p>
                <hr>
                <p> Update: After 2 months in the gym, I did gain some weight which lands me at the 70-percentile of the sampled weight distribution? Could you calculate how much I weight now?</p>
